# Description

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my <br>
website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load <br>
faster! <br>
Browse here, and find the flag!

# Solution

Here is a better formatted version of this writeup on [picoCTF Solutions website](https://picoctfsolutions.com/picoctf-2024-unminify).

By looking at the page source it is all on one line. With inspect element and then "expand recursively" by scrolling the flag is easily seen.

You could also use curl or wget with cat on the index.html file to easily see the flag. With curl this command could be used to get just the flag:

`curl -s http://titan.picoctf.net:54777/ | grep -oE picoCTF{.*} --color=none | cut -d "\"" -f1`

Flag: `picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_743...}`
